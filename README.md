## College Enrollement System

This project is a College enrollment system, in which students and staffs willing to join a particular college have to fill the form. The existing students and staff can see their details by logging in using their username and password that is sent to their respective mail id. The admin can see the database of both students and staff who are enrolled in our college. Also, the fee structure of hostel rooms can also be seen in table format. We used the derby database to store and retrieve data given by the students and staff.

## Jar files needed for this project
- `derby.jar` for database connectivity
- `javax.mail.jar, activation-1.1.1.jar` for sending mail for the student and staff who are enrolling.

## Folder Structure
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
